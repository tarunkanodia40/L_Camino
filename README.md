# L_Camino
This repository contains the project for course **CS350A: Principles of Programming Languages** done under Prof. Satyadev Nandakumar in 2022-23-I semester. This includes a parser and an beta-reducer (in Haskell) as well as in Ruby (along with test file for examples of what Ruby code accepts as input) for evaluation of λ-terms used in λ-calculus [LC], and hence the name L_camino :p (Breaking Bad Reference).
